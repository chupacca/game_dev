In order to use the `JumpSystem` on a GameObject in Unity, you will need to create a new `ComponentSystem` that inherits from the `JumpSystem` and attach it to a GameObject.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

1.  Create a new `Component` called `JumpSystemWrapper`
```C#
using Unity.Entities;
using UnityEngine;

public class JumpSystemWrapper : ComponentSystem
{
    protected override void OnCreate()
    {
        //Create an instance of the JumpSystem
        var jumpSystem = World.GetOrCreateSystem<JumpSystem>();
    }
    protected override void OnUpdate()
    {
        //Call the OnUpdate method of the JumpSystem
        World.GetExistingSystem<JumpSystem>().OnUpdate();
    }
}
```

2.  Attach the `JumpSystemWrapper` component to a GameObject in Unity. You can do this by right-clicking on the GameObject in the Hierarchy, selecting Add Component, and then selecting JumpSystemWrapper.
    
3.  Now the JumpSystemWrapper is running on the gameobject and it will execute the JumpSystem.
    

It's important to note that the above example is a simplified version, in a real-world scenario, you should consider the performance and scalability of your project and organize the code in a way that makes sense for your game. Also, you should make sure that the InputAction and the MMFeedbacks component is attached to the same gameObject as the JumpSystemWrapper.

You can also use the `World.DefaultGameObjectInjectionWorld` instead of creating a new gameObject to hold the JumpSystemWrapper, this way you don't need to create a new GameObject, but the downside is that you will have to make sure that the InputAction and the MMFeedbacks component is attached to the same gameObject as the GameObject that you are going to use the JumpSystemWrapper.

If you need to pass a reference to a MonoBehaviour component to the `JumpSystem`, you can use the following methods:

1.  Inject the reference in the `OnCreate` method of the `JumpSystemWrapper` and then pass it to the `JumpSystem` constructor.

```C#
using Unity.Entities;
using UnityEngine;

public class JumpSystemWrapper : ComponentSystem
{
    private InputAction inputAction;
    private MMFeedbacks mmFeedbacks;

    protected override void OnCreate()
    {
        inputAction = GetComponent<InputAction>();
        mmFeedbacks = GetComponent<MMFeedbacks>();
        var jumpSystem = World.GetOrCreateSystem<JumpSystem>();
        jumpSystem.inputAction = inputAction;
        jumpSystem.mmFeedbacks = mmFeedbacks;
    }
    protected override void OnUpdate()
    {
        //Call the OnUpdate method of the JumpSystem
        World.GetExistingSystem<JumpSystem>().OnUpdate();
    }
}
```

2.  Add the InputAction and MMFeedbacks fields to the JumpSystem and use the `GetComponent<>()` method to get a reference to the components in the `OnCreate` method.

```C#
public class JumpSystem : SystemBase
{
    public InputAction inputAction;

	// This is Key to the System
    public MMFeedbacks mmFeedbacks;

    protected override void OnCreate()
    {
        inputAction = GetComponent<InputAction>();
        
		// Should I get the Component based on a Tag Value?
        mmFeedbacks = GetComponent<MMFeedbacks>();
    }
    protected override void OnUpdate()
    {
        if(inputAction.triggered)
        {
            mmFeedbacks.PlayFeedbacks();
        }
    }
}
```

It's important to note that the `GetComponent<>()` method can be slow and should be used with caution, especially in performance-critical systems. Also, you should make sure that the InputAction and the MMFeedbacks component are attached to the same gameObject as the JumpSystemWrapper or the gameObject that you are going to use the JumpSystemWrapper. You could also use the `World.DefaultGameObjectInjectionWorld` to inject the GameObject's InputAction and MMFeedbacks

3. Or pass a component to the `JumpSystem`'s `OnCreate` method

You can pass a component to the `JumpSystem`'s `OnCreate` method.

You can do this by creating a new constructor for the `JumpSystem` and passing in the required component as a parameter.

For example:
```C#
public class JumpSystem : SystemBase
{
    public InputAction inputAction;
    public MMFeedbacks mmFeedbacks;

    public JumpSystem(InputAction inputAction, MMFeedbacks mmFeedbacks)
    {
        this.inputAction = inputAction;
        this.mmFeedbacks = mmFeedbacks;
    }

    protected override void OnUpdate()
    {
        if(inputAction.triggered)
        {
            mmFeedbacks.PlayFeedbacks();
        }
    }
}
```

Then in the `OnCreate` method of the `JumpSystemWrapper` you can use the `GetComponent<>()` method to get a reference to the InputAction and MMFeedbacks components that are attached to the same GameObject as the JumpSystemWrapper, and then you can pass these references to the JumpSystem.

```C#
protected override void OnCreate()
{
    inputAction = GetComponent<InputAction>();
    mmFeedbacks = GetComponent<MMFeedbacks>();
    var jumpSystem = World.GetOrCreateSystem<JumpSystem>();
    jumpSystem = new JumpSystem(inputAction, mmFeedbacks);
}
```

It's important to note that this is just one possible way of doing this and you should consider the performance and scalability of your project when choosing the best approach for your game. Also, you should make sure that the InputAction and the MMFeedbacks component are attached to the same gameObject as the JumpSystemWrapper or the gameObject that you are going to use the JumpSystemWrapper. You could also use the `World.DefaultGame...` (incomplete)
```
What could I use to make sure that the InputAction and the MMFeedbacks component are attached to the same gameObject as the JumpSystemWrapper or the gameObject that you are going to use the JumpSystemWrapper?
