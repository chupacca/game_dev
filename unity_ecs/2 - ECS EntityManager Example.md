public class ECSExample : MonoBehaviour

        var entityManager = World.Active.GetOrCreateManager<EntityManager>();

        // Create an entity with a position component
        var entity = entityManager.CreateEntity();
        entityManager.AddComponentData(entity, new Position { Value = Vector3.zero });

        // Update the position component every frame
        void Update()
        {
            var position = entityManager.GetComponentData<Position>(entity);
            position.Value += Vector3.right * Time.deltaTime;

### Creating an Entity

In Unity's ECS, you do not attach a component onto a Unity GameObject that has the `IComponentData`. Instead, you create an `Entity` and add the `IComponentData` to it.

An `Entity` in Unity's ECS is a unique identifier that represents an object in the game or application, it does not have any transform or renderer data associated with it, unlike a GameObject.

To create an `Entity` you can use the `EntityManager.CreateEntity()` method. Once you have an `Entity`, you can add `IComponentData` to it by using the `EntityManager.AddComponent<T>()` method, where T is the type of the `IComponentData`.

For example, you can create an Entity and add the JumpData component to it by using the following code:

```C#
Entity myEntity = Entity.CreateEntity();
Entities.AddComponent<JumpData>(myEntity);
```

It's important to note that Unity's ECS is a different way of developing games and applications than the traditional Unity's way of using GameObjects and Monobehaviour. It requires a different mindset and a different way of thinking about how to structure the code.
